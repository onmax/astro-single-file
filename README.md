## Why?

Recently, I had to build some HTML emails templates to send to some users where the final bundle is preferable to be in a single file for backend developers. That's why, only CSS and no JS files are being merged in the HTML file. If you would like to support JS files, you are welcome to submit a PR! 

### Installation
  
The `astro add` command-line tool automates the installation for you. Run one of the following commands in a new terminal window. (If you aren't sure which package manager you're using, run the first command.) Then, follow the prompts, and type "y" in the terminal (meaning "yes") for each one.
  
```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add astro-single-file
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add astro-single-file
# Using PNPM
pnpx astro add astro-single-file
```
  
__`astro.config.mjs`__

```js
import astroSingleFile from 'astro-single-file';

export default {
  // ...
  integrations: [astroSingleFile()],
}
```
  
Then, restart the dev server.


## Usage

This integration will after the build process finishes, using `astro:build:done` hook. It will look in the build directory and it will find all the references in your HTML files where it references an external CSS file which it will replace. Then, it will remove those CSS files.

## Configuration

At the moment, this integration does not have any configuration available. You're welcome to submit an issue or PR! 

## Troubleshooting

- If your installation doesn't seem to be working, make sure to restart the dev server.
- If you edit and save a file and don't see your site update accordingly, try refreshing the page.
- If you edit and save a file and don't see your site update accordingly, try refreshing the page.
- If refreshing the page doesn't update your preview, or if a new installation doesn't seem to be working, then restart the dev server.
